# SpamHam
SpamHam is a text-classification app which detects whether the message/email is spam or not. I've used Naive-Bayes along with NLP (TF-IDF, Bag of Words and more). <br>
In order to perform an experiment I've combined two datasets (Enron email spam/ham and SMS spam classification) into one to gather more data. 
To check out this project in action I've deployed it on heroku
